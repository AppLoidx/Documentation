## Internationalization

You can create a multi-language Game also pretty easily. To do so you need to do 4 simple things:

1. Go to the options.js file and change the `engine['MultiLanguage']` value to true.
2. Change your script.

The default Script looks like this:

```javascript
Monogatari.script ({
    'Start':[
        'Hi, welcome to your first Visual Novel with Monogatari.'
    ]
});
```

Your new Multi Language script will have language labels that look like this:
```javascript
Monogatari.script ({

    'English':{
        'Start':[
            'Hi, welcome to your first Visual Novel with Monogatari.'
        ]
    },
    'Espa√±ol':{
        'Start':[
            'Hola, bienvenido a tu primer Novela Visual con Monogatari.'
        ]
    }
});
```

3. If you need it, you can define new UI translations as follows:

```javascript
Monogatari.translation ('YourLanguage', {
    'SomeString': 'Your Translation'
});
```

4. A new Language select will be added to the Settings screen showing all the languages your game has available!
```

The value attribute of each option has to match the language labels available.
You can write on pretty much every language available for the web, so there's no limitation!
