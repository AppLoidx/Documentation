* Choices would not be shown correctly when using a normal dialog while on NVL mode or the other way around.
* Clearing the text box would remove the `nvl` class from it, causing some flickering and undesired behaviors.
* Save slots would not display correctly a non-image background.
* A library was missing from the Canvas action implementation, preventing its functioning.
* The spacing between the titles on audio settings has been fixed
