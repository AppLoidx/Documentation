# Step 2: Download Monogatari

Once you've got your [environment set up](step-1-setup-your-environment.md), it's time to download Monogatari!

All the releases can be found at the [Releases Page of the GitHub repository](https://github.com/Monogatari/Monogatari/releases). You can always find what's the latest release and download it by following [this link](https://github.com/Monogatari/Monogatari/releases/latest).

On every release, you'll find notes about new features, bug fixes and other relevant changes to the engine, in the very end of those notes, there's a section named _**Assets**_ where you'll find the ZIP file you need to download, usually named something like **Monogatari-vX.X.X.zip** where the Xs represent the version number. 

Download that zip file and extract its contents.
