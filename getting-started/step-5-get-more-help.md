# Step 5: Get More Help

While this documentation covers many parts of Monogatari's functioning, it does not cover everything you could actually do with it, remember, your VN is a website now and that means the possibilities are endless. Everything you've seen on a website before can be done in your game.

But how to look out for help on doing this things? Well, another benefit of your game being a website is: There is lots and lots of tutorials and documentation out there!

If you google something, for example if you want something to happen when someone clicks an image, you can google it as "JavaScript click image", there's no need to look for a Monogatari-specific answer, everything that applies to a website also applies for Monogatari, even the step-by-step tutorials on web development are useful to get you started.

But of course, you are not alone! If you have any doubt, problem or just want some help please contact me, I'll be glad to help in any way I can. Even though Monogatari is simple enough and you can find many resources online, I know it can be hard to get started and sometimes the documentation is not clear enough, so really, contact me anytime!

### Where to Ask Questions

The best place to ask questions is the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/sj4uPrP), where there is a good community and you can receive help from people making games just like you!

If you have some other doubts or prefer other type of communication, you can contact me on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@HyuchiaDiego) or via email which you can find in my [website](https://hyuchia.com/).

If you want to report bugs or request new features, then please report them on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Monogatari/Monogatari).
